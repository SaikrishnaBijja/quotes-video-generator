# Quotes Video Generator

## Overview  
Quotes Video Generator is a Python application that converts textual quotes into visually engaging short videos. It combines quote input (from a file or API) with background images or video clips, overlays text, and adds transitions, music, or effects to produce a shareable video. The project demonstrates skills in media processing, automation, and creative content generation.

## Features

- Addes background images or clips for each quote  
- Adds transitions, animations, or text effects  
- Incorporates background music or sound effects  
- Outputs videos in formats like MP4  
- Configurable duration, font, styling, and layout

-Select a background (image/video) for each quote
-Render quote text as overlay (using PIL, MoviePy, or similar)
-Add transitions or animations between scenes
-Mix in background music
